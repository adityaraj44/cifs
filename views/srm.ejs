      Housekeeping includes housecleaning that is, disposing of rubbish,
      cleaning dirty surfaces, dusting, and vacuuming. It may also involve some
      outdoor chores, such as removing leaves from rain gutters, washing
      windows, and sweeping doormats. The term housecleaning is often used also
      figuratively in politics and business, for the removal of unwanted
      personnel, methods, or policies in an effort at reform or improvement.

      Housecleaning is done to make the home look and smell better and to make
      it safer and easier to live in. Without housecleaning, lime scale can
      build upon taps, mold grows in wet areas, smudges appear on glass
      surfaces, dust forms on surfaces, bacterial action makes the garbage
      disposal and toilet smell and cobwebs accumulate. Tools used in
      housecleaning include vacuums, brooms, mops and sponges, together with
      cleaning products such as detergents, disinfectants and bleach
